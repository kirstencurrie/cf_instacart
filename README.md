# cf_instacart
This project includes Jupyter Lab notebook files for a mock analysis of Instacart Products and Orders. The data was originally obtained from Instacart (data source from Kaggle below), but prices and customer names were imputed with alternate data for learning purposes.

The following information came from a fictional business objective prompt in the Career Foundry's module #4 on intro to Python. 

## Objective
You’re an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store
that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to
perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria
